### Title

- It's all Set: A hands-on introduction to JuliaReach
 
### Abstract (500 characters)

JuliaReach is among the best-of-breed software addressing the fundamental problem of Reachability Analysis: computing the set of states that are reachable
by a dynamical system from all initial states and for all admissible inputs and parameters. We explain the role of
Julia's multiple dispatch to gain an unprecedented level of flexibility and expressiveness in this area. We explore diverse applications including differential equations, hybrid systems and neural network controlled systems.
